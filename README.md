# ROS2 Autonomous Warehouse Robot (Perception + Manipulation)

## Overview

This project presents an autonomous mobile robot system developed using ROS for smart warehouse automation.

The robot is capable of detecting, picking, transporting, and placing objects within a simulated warehouse environment. The system integrates computer vision, control, and robotic manipulation into a complete end-to-end pipeline.

This project demonstrates a complete perception–planning–control pipeline for autonomous robotic manipulation in warehouse environments.

## Problem Statement

Warehouse operations are often slow, repetitive, and labour-intensive, leading to inefficiencies and increased operational costs.

This project demonstrates how autonomous mobile robots can improve logistics efficiency by performing object handling tasks without human intervention, aligning with Industry 4.0 automation goals.

## System Architecture

Camera → OpenCV Detection → Control Logic → Navigation → Arm Controller → Object Manipulation

---

## System Workflow

1. Capture image from robot camera
2. Detect blue object using HSV colour filtering
3. Navigate towards object using velocity control
4. Activate robotic arm to pick up object
5. Transport object to predefined drop-off location
6. Release object and complete task

## Key Features

* Real-time object detection using OpenCV (HSV filtering)
* Autonomous navigation using `/cmd_vel`
* Custom robotic arm with PID control
* Full pick-and-place pipeline implementation
* Gazebo-based simulation environment

## Core Implementation

### Object Detection

* HSV colour space filtering used to detect blue objects
* Pixel thresholding ensures reliable object recognition
* Detection validated using pixel count and distance constraints

### Control System

* Linear velocity control for navigation (`/cmd_vel`)
* Arm control via position commands (`/arm_controller/command`)
* PID control defined in `controllers.yaml`

### Robot Modelling

* Custom URDF including:

  * Revolute arm joint
  * Suction pad end-effector
  * Additional structural components

* Gazebo plugins:

  * Differential drive controller
  * ROS control interface

## Simulation Environment

* Custom warehouse world (`warehouse.world`)
* Object model (`blue_cube.sdf`)
* Robot and environment launched using ROS launch file

---

## Results

* Successful detection of target object
* Smooth navigation towards object
* Reliable object pick-up using robotic arm
* Accurate transport and drop-off
* Full autonomous task execution
